          <h2>PALEOCONSERVATISM – The Ideology of Isolation and Tradition</h2>
          <p>
            Paleoconservatism is one of the six quasi-democratic or “fringe”
            political ideologies on the Map My Politics ideology chart,
            occupying the area on the top right above the populist,
            neoconservative and paleolibertarian zones and to the right of the
            fascist zone. Paleoconservatives consider themselves “traditional”
            conservatives who embrace capitalism, advocate isolationist and
            anti-immigrant policies, and favor making Judeo-Christian values
            part of the legal framework. To achieve those goals,
            paleoconservatives are willing to restrict certain personal and
            political freedoms that typify a liberal democracy. Because this
            essentially places paleoconservatives outside the norms of
            democratic governance, we consider paleoconservatism on the fringe
            of the more mainstream political ideologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paleoconservatism is an economically conservative and
            capitalist-leaning ideology and therefore occupies the right side
            the x-axis of economic liberty. Some paleoconservatives don’t
            believe in the same extreme free market policies as neoliberals,
            such as unrestricted trade, and often support the sort of
            restrictions on immigrant labor that true laissez faire ideologies
            like libertarianism reject. As such, paleoconservatism is more in
            line with fascism and extreme populism in its focus on social order
            and traditional values. For a paleoconservative, private ownership
            and capitalism certainly constitute traditional values, and for this
            reason it is economically “right-wing” in orientation. But as we
            shall see, paleoconservatives are primarily concerned with matters
            of personal morality and social cohesion, so they will never be
            mistaken for paleolibertarians or neoliberals. It’s probably enough
            to say that, in economic terms, paleoconservatives are basically
            pro-business conservatives and leave it at that.
          </p>
          <p>
            What truly identifies paleoconservatism as a conservative ideology
            is its place on the y-axis of social liberty. Paleoconservatives
            embrace traditional Christian values to such a degree that they
            willingly place their conception of morality above individual civil
            liberties. For American paleoconservatives in particular, calls for
            advancing a multicultural society with constitutional protections on
            speech, religion and personal freedom are rebuked as contrary to how
            things were at the nation’s founding and therefore improper. For
            example, paleoconservatives view same-sex marriage as immoral and
            unprotected by the law, and consider legalized abortion not as a
            woman’s constitutional right but as murder of an unborn child. It’s
            almost a given that paleoconservatives support the death penalty and
            even advocate for expanding the list of capital crimes.
            Paleoconservatism is readily distinguishable from neoconservatism
            for the latter’s emphasis on military intervention overseas as
            needed to make the world “safe for democratic values.”
            Paleoconservatives are essentially isolationist and have no desire
            to nation-build or otherwise project their values abroad. Rather,
            they wish to defend their nation at home, which means zealously
            guarding against perceived moral corruption. If that means a more
            authoritarian approach to civil liberties, says the
            paleoconservative, so be it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paleoconservatism as an ideology has its philosophical roots in the
            same conservatism of Edmund Burke, but it is a modern offshoot that
            traces its origins to the late 1960s when the Vietnam War and the
            civil rights movement were hot-button issues that divided
            conservatives. If paleoconservatism has an ideological “father” it
            might be Mel Bradford, an American literary scholar who supported
            George Wallace, the segregationist governor of Alabama, when he ran
            for president, and argued against military intervention in Southeast
            Asia. Like right-wing populism, paleoconservatism is essentially a
            reactionary ideology, similarly anti-establishment, anti-immigrant,
            anti-interventionist and anti-globalist in outlook. As Bradford
            wrote in his book, <i>The Reactionary Imperative</i>, “reaction is a
            necessary term in the intellectual context we inhabit in the
            twentieth century because merely to conserve is sometimes to
            perpetuate what is outrageous.” Other paleoconservative scholars
            include Paul Gottfried and Christian Kopff.
          </p>
          <p>
            The United States is – for the most part – a two-party system, and
            in recent times paleoconservatives typically associate with the more
            conservative GOP. Previously, Southern paleoconservatives might be
            found in the Democratic Party and paleoconservatives also identify
            with third parties, such as the American Independent Party, or as
            independents. Regardless how a paleoconservative chooses to engage
            politically, however, an overriding feature of their participation
            will be a focus on the traditional values of God, country and
            family. As we stress repeatedly on the Map My Politics site,
            politics at its most fundamental level is about ideology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paleoconservatism has been a presence in American politics in modern
            times at the periphery, more in shaping policy than in electing
            avowed paleoconservative politicians. The Ohioan Robert Taft was an
            “Old Right” paleocon before the term was invented and he was a
            persuasive influence on the post-war Republican Party, as was the
            John Birch Society. Perhaps the most prominent paleoconservative
            politician in America has been Pat Buchanan, a former staff member
            in the Nixon and Reagan administrations who ran for president both
            as a Republican and as a Reform Party candidate. Buchanan has also
            been a successful political news commentator and writer. Other
            paleoconservative writers include Sam Francis, Steve Sailer and John
            Derbyshire. Many credit these and other paleocons with the more
            reactionary, populist tilt of the Republican Party under Donald
            Trump.
